An increasingly common trend is the use of domain hacks, wherein one uses TLDs
in an unintended or unconventional way. I've noticed this recently in the
primary instance of [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious),
[invidio.us](https://invidio.us). While incorporating the TLD into the domain
name like this might be more visually appealing and perhaps elegant, there are
several downsides to doing so in my view.

Each time I type that URL I find myself having to backtrack two characters to
insert the period for the TLD. I perceive it as a single word, hence my typing
habits oblige me to type the word in its entirety without pausing. If I attempt
to insert the period before completing the word, it breaks my flow and I can't
easily work out _where_ the period should go.

Now imagine you're telling someone to visit one of these domains - how do you
pronounce it? "Invidio, dot, us"? Or "Invidious with a dot between the _o_ and _u_"?
Imagine dictating such a domain to a less technologically savvy individual who
is only used to hearing "dot com" and their regional equivalent.
Of course, they may still be able use a search engine to find what they're
looking for unless they're typing in a shortened URL (the horror).

All of these are unnecessary inconveniences introduced just so your domain name
looks a bit prettier.

Not using appropriate TLD also removes information normally contained within a
domain name: the type of entity the website is for. `.com` for company, `.net`
for networks, and regional variations of each. TLDs have a semantic purpose - a
purpose which is discarded if they're used in a hacky name.

Of course, this website is itself guilty of using a TLD in an unintended manner
\- _.me_ is for Montenegro, but here it instead represents a personal website.
This hack is so commonly used to the point that this alternate meaning for the
TLD is widely accepted, and even [touted by the registrars](https://domain.me).
Thus, I thought it was an acceptable choice for my own personal website.

Ideally there would be an TLD that better applied to a generic personal website.
There are some other TLDs I considered, before I eventually settled on _.me_ as
being my favourite option:

- `.pro`: My website doesn't contain exclusively information relating to my
  professional career; it's also for personal purposes
- `.info` & `.site`: Too generic - all websites are "sites", and virtually all
  of them contain information. This site also contains information that isn't
  specifically related to me
- `.blog`: My website isn't _exclusively_ a blog
- Regional TLDs: I didn't want to pigeonhole myself into a particular location
  in case I relocate at any point in my life. Further, where I live isn't a
  significant part of my identity
- Other new TLDs: Could confuse people who didn't even know they existed, and/or
  don't know how to type them

Unfortunately transferring to a new domain can be quite a pain, so for the
foreseeable future I'm stuck on williamvds.me, even if a more appropriate TLD
appears.
